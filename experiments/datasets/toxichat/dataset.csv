"utterance 0: Think about it for a second. There's nothing holding women or their sexual partners back from using condoms, pills, IUDs, pulling out, etc., yet they still foam at the mouth at the idea that they will have to be accountable for who they let fuck them raw. Disgusting.

utterance 1: Isn‚Äôt electricity already privatized, if not regulated? And water is also privatized in some cities. The difference would be to let go of the regulations.
