They knew what would happen with these uncivilized animals and what they would do and they did exactly that to the women -young girls- and even have raped men.

That is some aggressive sentencing there, I am absolutely certain that will deter such behavior from them in the future.

Person2: The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well.

"Person1: The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.

"Person1: Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.
Person2: Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.",1

"Person1: I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
Person2: To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?",1
"Person1: The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.
Person2: Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?",0
"Person1: I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
Person2: The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.",0

"Person1: Freedomscout thinks the public schools are like Pink Floyd's The Wall.
Person2: There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.",1

Person2: Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.",0
"Person1: Freedomscout thinks the public schools are like Pink Floyd's The Wall.
Person2: The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.",1

The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!
Person2: While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now. But even that has been a symptom of the inner decay in the lives of so many people who have lost the moral compass that used to guide our culture.",1

Person2: These are celebrities? They are monkeys howlling at the moon! North Carolina has the right to make laws for their own state. Obama does NOT, and neither do any of your so called celebrities! What you and many others forget is that the United States of America is a collection of dependent states having their own morals and laws. Obama thinks that President means KING. It doesn't. It means limited leader. There are many things he cannot legally do, and this happens to be one of them!",0

"Person1: Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485.
Person2: He did like millions of Mexicans and other illegals have done. Used a dead person number or made up a number. Some even use their children number if they were born in the U.S. A fake social security card in Phoenix runs about $100",1

His uncle is protected, ICE has been ORDERED to stay away from him, and local law enforcement has been told they are not to arrest him or harass him anymore. Look it up, this is true.

Of course, there needs to be total E-verify compliance enforced to prevent undocumented people from holding jobs.

"Person1: Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church. Until a determination of resolve between the State and Church can be made concerning the individual. An individual that leaves the Church grounds is subject to the full extent of the Law. The State is liable for the damages caused by the imposing of the Catholic Religion on the people.
Person2: When the blatant anti- Christian asault by the Administration and Democrats at every level is ceased then some credence can be accorded to the ""sanctuary"" argument. SANCTUARY cities are run by virulent secularists and Liberals. They are a recruiting ground for ILLEGAL voters and a means to bolster the population for districting purposes. Sadly the American catholic Church is only afactor when some Liberal tenet can be contrived, If the Catholic Church had any real clout every legislator,Pelosi and Biden comes to mind,purporting to be a Catholic and being supporters of any and all legislation supporting abortion and taxpayers paying for it would be publicly excommunicated. That has not happened and the Catholic Church is no longer the bastion of morals that could once influence elections. Sanctuary Cities are the creation of Liberals looking for support from legal minorities. RELIGIONhas nothing to do with it unless you are an amoral athiest...",1
"Person1: I think cutting off federal funds to cities who do not enforce current law is a dandy idea. Nothing would make them move faster to fix that sanctuary attitude of aiding and abeting illegals in the commission of a crime - staying here illegally, working here using false papers (fraud) or worse.
Person2: Sanctuary Is a place of refuge for Individuals that are appealing to the people of a State and not the State itself. A plea for personal protection in full recognition of their gilt in the breaking of the laws of a State. A safe zone of apprehension by the People for the protection of all. Where they can safely present their case of circumstances that led them to having no other alternative than to brake the States Laws. For when a State itself is involved in the granting of Sanctuary it is in conflict of interest to itself and the people thereof.",0

Person2: My entire family including me, my wife, my kids and grandkids entire wardrobes could not be valued at $20,000.00- the amount the Obama girls paid for their individual party dresses. Many in America are ""waking up"" and are fed up with a government that works harder at seeing the wealthy get theirs while tens of millions of American men and women are out of work, while many who were at one time productive workers with homes for their families, families who participated in community and school activities and were working to achieve the American Dream has been pushed aside to allow immigrants, legal and illegal, to come here and work! Obama and his administration has turned their backs on the American people and America! Obama is quick to point our how many new jobs were created in America but ; he never points out how many were lost, how many of the jobs filled were filled with immigrant workers (his own Labor Department says 3 out of four jobs in America is being taken by immigrants (legal and illegal) or how many men and women who at one time had jobs have run out of unemployment benefits, can not get work and are no longer counted in the ""Official"" Unemployment numbers. He does not point out the massive, huge, and growing national debt that the nation has grown under his administration. Could it be Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton was done so history will have someone else to show as the worst president in our history? She has one of American politics worst personal records already; electing her president will end in disaster and Obama will no longer have to face the reputation of Americas Greatest Presidential failure and the books showing him as the worst president in our history! confussed ""He's a fraud"" ""He's a thin skinned Fake"" What lets delete that!",0

You would not invite them back. For over 200 years, we have had guests come to our American front door. We've invited them in, helped them get settled, made them part of our great American Family. That's who we are. But the criminals who insist on breaking down the back door to get in illegally, and then expect the rest of us to just say it's OK, are just not welcome.

"Person1: The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.)

Person2: It is otherwise: you live in a fantasy world. The problem is people like you and Ms Snarth, the current President, the ""reverends"" (Al and Jesse), every liberal-socialist, etc. etc. who think that everything is about ""phobia"", ""hate"" and ""race"". Because of the first amendment, your ability to spout the foul libelous statements and baseless accusations is protected. Because of the first amendment, you're going to have to learn to let those who disagree with you continue to disagree. Tragedies happen. Sometimes by our own inattention, and sometimes with no warning or ability to prevent them. When no crime is committed, then those involved in the tragedy should be left alone to grieve.",0

That Gator laid in wait for that innocent little boy and did what an Alligator known to do. Strike very fast and drag under water. So sad for the family, that I am.

Person2: Technically they were in compliance with the signs as neither one was swimming. There are thousands of places around the gulf coast that say no swimming and like these signs they are permanent. Sometimes it's as simple as tree stumps being removed to make, as in this case, a man made lake. The owners don't want people hurt on the remaining stumps until they have rotted away. They walked together on a beach and the little boy was in less than 12"" of water. Now if the signs that were posted would have said ""DANGER ALLIGATORS IN WATER"" I could see how you might have a point. However, you do not.",0
