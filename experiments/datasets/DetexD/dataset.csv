"AI is an amazingly useful tool. But it basically works by amassing vast quantities of data points about our human activity, looking for correlations and then extrapolating into the future. And there are limitations to doing that. If you’re looking for data points about what we do and say, you tend to ignore social silences because what we don’t say by definition doesn’t get recorded. Secondly, correlation is not causation: you can’t understand why people are doing things if you assume that everything can be judged just by looking at correlations and data points. Thirdly, context change, which means that what happened in the recent past doesn’t always reflect what’s going to happen in the future.",0

"Clinical trials cost money and they cost a lot of money. Pharmaceutical companies have that money and they come out with all sorts of supposedly reliable evidence. As most of us know, however, much of the data in these studies are manipulated and massaged into what the pharmaceutical company wants the data to say. Just spend some time on Cl Psych’s website, or Philip Dawdy’s Furious Seasons. Go into the pharma blogosphere for more evidence. An easy example of this, commonly known, is how antidepressants tend to perform only about 2 points better than placebo and still get hailed as wonder drugs. If you take a closer look at the studies the slight performance over placebo has to be questioned as well. Read Grace Jackson’s Rethinking Psychiatric Drugs for a closer look at how trials are done and how people who might negatively effect positive outcome for drugs are often let go and not even allowed in the study. We have no reason to trust clinical trials done by pharmaceutical companies in most cases. So I don’t trust clinical trials in general. I’m not saying there are no credible trials, of course that is not true, but one has to study the study carefully to know how credible they are.",1

"Country men make me weak in the knees. I dated one for 4 years. He put me right in the kitchen and as any good boy would, I thiccened him right up and played with his belly every night after he exerted the utmost epitome of masculinity by raping my boyhole, kissing my body and making me feel like a young virgin lady. His smell was enough to put me in a trance. I would ask him not to shower for days so I could breathe his pheromones and sniff under his foreskin for hours. The way he would gently enter my hole then energetically thrust with masculine force made my eyes roll back. I would ride him for hours kissing his neck while his hands squeezed my ass. When he came in me I instantly want to have his babies. I keep his sperm in me for as long as I can. He loves when I keep his sperm in. He slaps my ass and calls me “his boy” around the house. He gets drunk and I early wait for his sweet rape. He forced himself on me drunk. I’ve never felt so safe and loved. He lived for my happiness, he focuses on the simple things in life, he cured my mental illness with his sperm, he made me feel special. When he called me “boy” it made me melt. Women are useless creatures. Country boys will bring you closer to god. They will live for you, they will treat you better than gold. They are the only true men left.

"Good advice. I Did a lot of drugs. I was smoking a lot of pot & hanging around with idiots; after around 4 years of it I was sectioned at 17/18; & that was the beginnings of 20 odd years of severe MH issues. It took a long time to stop the drugs; & drop the fools. Now older, & off drugs, I see people getting into problems a lot. I know an 18 year old girl that is smoking pot, drinking & doing some other drugs - she is going insane; but she won't listen, I don't bother trying to help any more. I think that people have to work things out for themselves - people don't generally want to learn from the experience of others - although they could do if they tried.",1

Hello everyone. I'm new. I'm experiencing really bad physical anxiety symptoms that just won't go away. It hits me bad at night. I get really bad pins and needles in arms and legs. I get really intense feelings of dread that spread all over my neck(like the painful lump in throat feeling) and head(up the ears). The thing that tips it over is its a million times worse when I lie down. My whole body feels like it's on overdrive and I get really anxious for no reason. Ive had sleepless nights and its really traumatic. The sensations in my head and neck are unbearable. I feel really hopeless I don't know how to fix it or get rid of it. It's ruining my life. Anyone else feels this way? I feel alone in all this with my family. I feel dysfunctional. Like I'm not normal.,1

Hummm  my ex was Swedish. Lots of fun. But your kind of on the wrong forum. This really inst America America. They aren't like real Americans they speak in some other languages (look around) and im not sure of what ever else. This just happens to be on the same map. But my best advice would be to really narrow down what part of teh US you want to see and why. Born and raised here in Cali and once you travel you willl see that every state is DIFFERENT. There is no other city in the world like NY. California was one of the last states bulidt so its bulidt different. Different looks feels and cultures.  Your young.

It all seemed wonderful, I just feel so frustrated that he doesn't understand that it was simply based on my fears, I just cannot understand why he would reject me for that. One of the reservations I had was his age, I was thinking of reasons why it couldn't work and that was one of them, he is 22, I am 30. He is",0

I also think that they should target those that are not ill but have just been claiming benefits and get them off their backsides. The same goes for single parents.

I am not the one in the wrong here!!!!!!!! I did my best to help her and she would not accept it - instead she told lies about me to everyone and tried to make me the bad person.

I am only addressing my issues with medication (probably not the best way).  I take Zoloft (generic version) daily which helped get me past the point of just waiting for things to be over (never looking forward to anything).  I also have Xanax (generic version) that helps when my mind begins to race or I feel myself starting to get very anxious.  I’ve had a few panic attacks and they are awful (so I look to the Xanax to prevent getting to that level).  I see a psychiatrist a couple times a year but I don’t feel a connection to him.  He’s ok and continues to prescribe what I need (I don’t have an addictive personality).  I do find myself needing the Xanax more with current world events and being basically locked down...,1

Will the trap become quite popular among the other soldiers? I find that it's common in stories for a character that crossdresses to enter a space exclusively for the opposite gender to become quite popular in that space. Consciously almost everyone is fooled, unconsciously everyone sees through the disguise and wants the crossdressers attention because they are the only source of attention from the opposite gender. Of course, in your story, that Beastwoman who ambushed him wasn't fooled which was why she only tackled and smothered him in her breasts instead of killing him.",1

"I don’t like being around people either. Just because how it makes me feel and how bad my anxiety and thoughts will become. I don’t like to make people feel uncomfortable with my uncomfortableness. It’s just a horrible feeling. I’m really sensitive to body language as well so when I see people are looking at me weirdly it just makes things so much worse. I just tend to avoid it as much as I can. I wake up in the morning and my goal is isolation, stay inside and to be alone from outsiders. This wasn’t the case in the beginning. I was actually a confident young lad and loved socialising and being around people. It took my years to actually except the change and now (not good for me) im actually in a way content with it. I’ve adapted to it and the thought of going out is just the worst thought ever. I’m happy inside (most of the time). I’m in a situation now though where this has to change and I’m having to fight this battle head on. And not hide inside. Get panic attacks just thinking about it.",1

I have a huge fear of being left.  I had two friends treat me very badly before my wedding and I have fallen out with them, and feel abandonment from them, and all in all, I know I am scared that it will all be too much, as my husband is the most relaxed and amazingly cheerful man, and I know he loves me and just wants to see me happy.",1

I feel your pain. I'm the exact same. I can leave the house if I've got my hubby with me but apart from that I'm basically housebound and the walls are closing in on me!! I've been like this for nearly 2 years and I've had psychologists and psychiatrists but nothing seems to work. I'm now getting CBT so we'll see how that goes. If I try to go out myself I get a panic attack and I lose all the feeling in my fingers and can hardly breathe then I get a terrible headache. I've also got irritable bowel syndrome and neck and shoulder pain because of my anxiety. Its not nice!! So please don't feel you're on your own.,1
"I first felt pulled to the performing arts during the big Disney channel boom of, when shows like Camp Rock and Hannah Montana made the 10-year-old me want to be a pop star. I sang in choirs and school productions on and off, and received external validation that I had a talent for performing. But when I went to UC Berkeley, I didn't even consider an education in the arts. Computer science was the hot thing, and at the time my desire to do art wasn't as important as my desire to be successful in the more traditional sense.

Sometimes it would look great and other times the facial movements and structure would be a little off or different. Maybe it was just different lighting or camera angles, but either way it really pulled me out of the game",0
"I fully accept what you are saying & like parenting, caring for a person with mental health illness doesn`t come with a manual. I`m no expert in this area but i do feel i have learnt a lot in the last 2 years, i can see all the signs & i know she`s getting ill again but trying to get her to get help is impossible.    By the way my daughter is 31 years old, going on 3 some days,she has led a completely independent life since she was 18, so i don`t feel like i`m over protective or trying to control her in any way. In fact one of the most draining aspects on me is when she starts to deteriorate, she is constantly on the phone, morning, noon & night. She phones just to hear my voice i think, because her anxiety levels get so bad, she`s scared but won`t admit it. I get so frustrated because if she took her meds she wouldn`t be so poorly, she`s an intelligent woman so how come she can`t see the logic of taking the meds to control the symptoms.                                               To be honest i`ve no idea of the best way to support her, everything is trial & error, which is how i feel i`m learning all the time, but whats the point of me being able to recognise the early symptoms if she won`t do anything about it. She really is her own worst enemy & yet i feel for her since her thought patterns are the way  they are because she is mentally ill, seems like she`s in a catch 22.                                                                     How do other carers cope ?, i find she is very draining when i`m with her & yet i worry myself sick when she`s not here or in contact & before anyone tells me she will have to learn the hard way i`ve been down that road several times to no avail.                                                                    Others on this forum have told me how difficult is was accepting they had mental illness & i guess she must still be in denial. I`m not going to be around forever & its important to me to know she will be able to cope on her own. I`ve told her about this forum & she doesn`t want to know. I guess you can lead a horse to water but you can`t make it drink.",1
"I get a lot of mood swings. I'll be really depressed and hate everything and everyone and then a few hours later I'll be full of energy and I'll want to go out and do something, I never know what I want to do though, the only way I can put it is it's like I'm a 2 year old on a sugar rush. I'll go from hating life to loving life and my self esstem goes through the roof. My thoughts are always racing, it takes me hours to fall asleep because I can't turn my brain off, sometimes I get no sleep or a couple of hours and I'm more energetic then when I get a good nights sleep. Sometimes I oversleep. My appetite changes a lot, some days I'll eat next to nothing and others I'll eat loads.",1
"I get that it's on me and this is largely because I've inextricably fetishised hypnosis at this point, but if it happened I'm certain I'd feel practically cheated on, I'm not sure I could look at her as the same again and it'd probably be a step toward the end of our relationship",0
"I grew up with homeschooling and a mom who was highly supportive of my art ambitions. But that still wasn’t enough to get me to a high level. I guess I didn’t experiment enough? Or didn’t practice enough? Or wasn’t able to get high level tutoring? I’m not really sure. Now, I’m just “pretty good”, but nothing I make particularly impresses anyone except for laymen who know nothing about art.",0
"I guess it's kind of the same with me.  Never have been close to my parents, just worked hard at school.  Felt they were pushing too hard for me to get my degree (which I did) but I had to do it all alone - they never helped.  I think I just don't know how to get close to people.  But then it doesn't seem like there is anyone who wants to know me, so that's not really much of an issue right now.",1
"I had a roommate once who kind of repressed his curiosities who was into me. I tried to make something happen once but I was way too drunk and he just laughed it off. But he joked about it with me afterward so only I could hear. And there was another time where he was drunk and I was sober and basically said because he didn't get laid at a party, it was my job to suck his dick that night. I laughed it off then too. Still think about him a lot lol",1

"I had anorexia for several years in my 20s, I'm now 54. It was a long slow process for me with several hospitalisations.  I think there comes a time when you know you want to get better but it's one step forward and two steps back.  Looking back I think for me it was the strong urge to have children and as I wasn't having periods my doctor warned me that I was compromising my ability to have kids.  I'm not sure how I did it but I got there.  I imagine for most anorexics there are issues which need to be looked at, there certainly was for me.  I've been married for nearly 30 years with 3 healthy grown up children. To be realistic I still consider myself to have an eating disorder as I have trouble controlling my weight.  I'm a bit overweight at the moment and still overeat at times (not binging though).  However the eating problems are not in the forefront of my life anymore.  I think it would be unrealistic of me to tell you everything is fine once you gain weight and as you get older. I still have a crazy habit of literally falling out of bed onto my scales every morning without fail! I also do this if I wake in the middle of the night so I can be found weighing myself with the light of my mobile phone",1
I had really hoped time would lessen the burden for me but it doesn’t seem to be the case for you Connor. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I am constantly reliving and ruminating. I don’t want to leave my wife and kids but I feel like there is no escape,1

"I hate myself, I wish I could look like all the skinny, beautiful women on TV. I've hinted once or twice to my parents that I want to lose weight. One time she was showing off to my aunt about her new jeans that were a size twelve, and I said ""you're only a size bigger than me, I feel fat now!"" (I'm nearly 15, and my own mother's only 1 size bigger than me!) and she replied with ""you're not fat, don't be stupid, its just your height"". But I'm not all that tall, I'm about 5""6.",1
"I have BP which I was diagnosed with just over 2 years ago although I have pretty much suffered with it since becoming an adult I think. I recently spent 3 weeks in a psychiatric unit because I had been on an extremely extended manic period i.e. 10 months and then finally lost the plot completely and was about to leave my husband and 3 kids. Not good. Now I am on quite a downer but am just focusing on one day at a time. If there is anybody with BP out there that wants to chat, I will more than happy. Hopefully we can help each other.",1
I have Bipolar I and am quite well at the moment.  I get DLA at the middle rate because I am considered a danger to myself.  This is because when I get stressed I get a form of dissociation and I get seriously suicidal to the point where I am in danger of killing myself - 3 or 4 times a year.  When you get DLA you do get a letter saying why it's been awarded.  I don't report changes because I could be well today and seriously ill tomorrow.,1

"I have experiences I still can't confront, it was not repeated efforts by a single person but lets say a number of different scenarios with different people.

I have had two different attempts at CBT. The first was delivered by somone with very little experience and understanding and although they were good to the point where I could recognise that I was feeling ill it left me feeling rather inadequate and stupid and eventually I gave up. This was delivered in 40 min session and no clear goals or problems identification was ever drawn up. My second attempt at CBT has been a little more effective but most of all I have felt empowered and in charge of my own treatment. CBT does look at the here and know but it does examine past experiaces that have led to the formulation of thinking patterns. The big DANGER I feel with CBT is when it is delivered by inexperienced professionals who are not able to deliver the full benefits of the therepy because they are not adequatly trained and therefore it can be ineffective and useless. When the therepy is done on the cheap which seems to be happening in the NHS.,1

OP, as for good to remember when in AR, I really hate to admit it, but I really don't think we have one dish that says ""AR"" on it. We have great little places to eat or you can go totally upscale and eat at top of the line eateries, but that still doesn't mean we have one true native dish.",0
I hope I'm not speaking out of turn but could it possibly be that your friend was feeling out of sorts himself. I know there have been times (before I was ill) that I had said I was going to do something then really didn't want to. I think you should speak to him and just ask if it was just today he didn't want to go with you or whether he just doesn't feel that he can go with you at all. Theres no point in beating yourself up when you don't really know whats happened. I hope you get it sorted out but if your friend can't go with you can you not maybe make a phone appointment with your doctor? I'm agoraphobic so my doctor always gives me a phone consultation even though she'd rather see me. Could you speak to your practise and see if this is an option?,0

I should have said I have no personal knowledge or connection with the scheme discussed. In Birmingham (where I live) there is a so-called 'Bibliotherapy' scheme but it is quite different - it operates on the basis that GP's can give patients a 'Book Presecription' - a recommendation of a certain book which they can take along to their local library. The library service have ordered lots of copies of these books. But the books are all self-help books and all on a CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) priniciple. This is fine as far as it goes but not for people (I am one) for whom CBT does not work. It is not really bibliotherapy in the sense in which it is being used in Liverpool (which I had never heard of till I read this article).,0
I should probs mention too that I have for about 3 years now had all the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome which my doctor loosely banded about as a diagnosis after exhausting the blood tests and ecg tests etc and I have no physical ailment apparently.

Sometimes I also believe people know what i'm thinking.  WHen i'm suicidal i feel like the police know and so they follow me around.  I also feel like im being followed when im walking, sometimes i'll see shadows around me and im sure someon is there too.  I also see things fly past the corner of my eye, but when i look theres nothing there.  I'm not sure what this is, is it paranoia or is it just my mind playing tricks on me?

I wonder what kind of spider that was.  I once saw one like that at my old house and it could actually jump!  I think Mom called it a Wolf Spider or some such.

No idea what the bugs might be.  I've never seen anything like that here.  Hope you get rid of them and the spider stays away!!,0

"I'm currently on 375g of Venlafaxine backed up with Lithium, Mirtazapine and Flupentixol. It was only when my psy added in the mirtazapine that I noticed any difference. I had been on mirtazapine as a stand alone AD but it had done nothing. I have been labelled as drug resistant. While I did notice some difference my mood still fluctuates wildly and has most recently been on a downward tack.",1
"I'm currently on Mirtazapine and Venlafaxine and I think the greatest effects they have are the side effects.  I've been depressed for so long, that I don't even know what medication does to me.  I've found CBT and in particular the ""Overcoming Depression"" book to be far more effective.  Problem is, CBT is obviously far more expensive than sticking someone on anti-depressants.",0
I'm doing a study on hands and feet right now so that it'll be easier to draw them next time. I agree with you on the jittery lines. Been using my ipad w/procreate to animate these and the surface is much smoother than traditional sketch pad and I'm still getting used to it. I think adding some streamline to the brush will help.,0

"I'm going to be attending Emory for grad school beginning this fall and am actually going to Atlanta today to try to find an apartment. I've been browsing the forums and there has been a lot of helpful information about housing in Decatur/Atlanta. The consensus seemed to be that living in Decatur, particularly around Emory, is safe. My primary concern in looking for an apartment is safety. I'm willing to up the price that I pay for a 1 BR to ensure safety/security (I'd pay up to 1200ish). I've visited the area twice (most recently in April) and it seemed ok to me. However, I've been reading apartment reviews about many of the apartment complexes within the Emory area (Gables Rock Springs, Paces Park, Highland Square, etc...all of which seem to be pricey/luxury apts) and was surprised to find at least a few reviews for each complex where tenants indicate both car and apartment break-ins to be common. I even read a few (perhaps this was for the Heights at Clairmont...a little further away) reviews saying these apt complexes were right next to crack houses.",0

Looking back, my ""embarrasing"" moments are when I'm depressed her ratthan optimistic.  I dont really take risks when I'm happy.  I just tend to be very productive, work hard, have great self-confidence and see bright things for my future.  I quite like looking back at myself in these phases.  Sometimes I get too loud and friends shush me if we're in public but this isn't too embarassing.  They like my eccentric side.  I actually see this stuff as part of my character, even if it doesn't happen very often.",0

Much appreciated.,0

"I'm not going to get another bunny now because we just want to concentrate on getting Elvi (surviving bunny) through this.  He was next to Harvey and sitting with him when he died, so he knows what's happened.  As the vet's receptionist said when we were discussing it afterwards, at least Elvi knows what happened - it's not as if we just took a live Harvey away to the vet and Elvi never saw him again.  Both myself and Elvi were with him at the end.",1
"I'm not usually into the whole ""girls who would kick my ass get me horny"", but Rider is an exception. She's tall as fuck and can dominate me anytime she wants, would be a dream come true. And the way she is ""I've only had Sakura for one week, but if anything were to happen to her, i would kill everyone in this world and then myself"" makes me admire her on top of being horny for her.",1
I'm on a mood stabilizer an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. My doc said BP depression is hard to treat. My issue is that I have no quality of life. I'm so miserable and unhappy 24/7. I thought the purpose of getting on meds was to improve quality of life. I just survive and that's it sometimes I'm barely doing that. I was happier off meds until I went dangerously into a mixed episode with psychotic features. No I don't want to get off meds I'm just frustrated.,1

Like at the moment, I'm with this guy and he's lovely and really trying to help but I can't seem to take it in at all. He'll give me a compliment and I'll forget it. He's off to uni on Saturday and I'm so scared that he'll meet someone else but instead of relaxing and letting things go a bit, I keep getting angry at him which pushes him away anyway. I don't know what to do anymore. Would it be easier to break up with him even though I care about him a stupid amount? I don't know how to change otherwise. It's easier to say that i'll think more positive but negative thoughts just completely override everything.",0
I'm sorry but I had never even heard of kolpophobia before reading your post. It's obviously quite a rare condition. I presume that you have seen doctors where you live. What have they said to you about getting treatment? Have you not been offered any therapy to maybe help you overcome your fears?,1
"I'm sorry you are not feeling too great. I don't know whether suicidal thoughts are good or bad, but I do think they can get habitual. After years of depression I got into a habit and cycle of suicidal thoughts, even if I wasn't feeling so bad.

I've been lucky with my employer but I think they are quite forward thinking. I can beleive it will be difficult for some getting a job although in theory the new Disability Discrimination Act that has been brought in makes it unlawful to reject an application based on mental health issues.

"I've been taking it for a few years, now, and have had not side effects from taking it, or at least any I can see. I experienced pretty immediate positive effects from the drug; for one, it allowed my mind to quiet at night so I could fall to sleep slightly more easily than I used to be able to, which was a godsend. That said, I can definitely say it feels like one of the milder drugs I've been prescribed. It's not going to be like flipping a switch one day and you'll notice. It kind of eases you into its benefits.",0

I was convinced that they would strangle me in my sleep (some of the other patiants).  I thought no one could help because the situation was to big well people involved.  I stayed up for 3 and a half days until the staff put me to sleep with meds.  I hope next time I realise that i'm i'll like some of you do.  I've only had 2 episodes now but I never realise, the last I ended up putting through 5 windows on a neighbours house over the back garden convinced of things i wont go into.

I've been using CBD for about a year now. Spent a lot of time researching it as there's a lot out there and many of the sites just glance over the actual science and focus on marketing.

IMO I think Taylor still looks fantastic. She's not as thin as she was a few years ago but neither am I. It's the natural progression as one ages. She's still one of the most beautiful women out there but she shows it now without all the sequins and makeup. It's a more subtle approach but I for one am a fan.,0

Sometimes I would pour bleach all over it to prevent me from bingeing on the rest of it.

"Is there any way to order an Aneros to an address other than mine, without getting an expensive PO box? Even when on the checkout page I can't select a shipping option so its a seemingly random decision between USPS or FedEx, I think FedEx has an option to pick up at one of their stores instead of delivering it directly to you, but since I can't even confirm it will be FedEx until ordering, I don't know if that will work. When researching it I saw someone mention that you can insert a UPS stores address instead of your own and pick things up there for $5, but I can't find anything about that on the UPS website. Is there any other option?",0

They are notorious in the WEG scene for what happened, and their subsequent meltdown over people calling them out on ulmf (premier porn game forum before f95 existed).

"Ive had OCD since I was a child. It has ruled my life and I don't know what to do anymore. When I was a kid it was simple. Dirty hands and germs. I honestly feel like those with Cleaning OCD are so lucky. Because I feel its impossible to recover from the kind I have. I have the Religious OCD. The OCD about things you can't see. Its scary as hell. Im a Christian. Jesus is my Lord and Savior. I believe Jesus is God's son and that God rose him from the dead. You see that? I had to write that (even though it's true) because my thoughts are telling if I don't that im denying God. How do I know if I've done something wrong? I can't ask God like I ask a person . So how do I know? I dont. Thats the problem. There is no reassurance. So how do you recover from a kind of OCD like that? Everything I do, including breathing or drinking a soda gets turned into a religious matter. If I drink, they tell me  that I'm agreeing to doing something sinful. If I close my eyes to sleep at night I'm doing something wrong. I don't want to die. But I don't want to live like this either. I'm begining to give up and getting depressed. Im begging for help but no one seems to be able to. Im stuck and I'm afraid that I will be for the rest of my life. I'm so jealous. You people who don't suffer ever day from mental torment. Its not fair. I wish I was someone else. But I'm stuck as me. And no matter how many time I confront thoughts and ignore them they just come back 3xs stronger. And I feel like im just too far gone in OCD to ever make it back to a happy life. If you pray to Jesus, please pray for me. But yes, I am a born again Christian. Jesus is my Lord and Savior. I believe he is Gods son and that God rose him from the dead.",1

Most recently this has excellated to the extent that we have very short periods of good times, he can manage to go to work but when at home his personality and feelings are extremely difficult to deal with.  We recently watched the programme about 'The Mind' where famous sports people were talking obout their experiences and that it was important to go and seek help.  I've started looking on the internet to see what to do, I have spoken to colleagues who have advised similar and other herbal remedies, like St Johns Whort, which seemed to make him sleep very deeply and feel uncomfortable.  My worry is for his health as he is also an insulin dependant diabetic and experiencing great difficulties eating so sugar readings are bouncing from high to low at the moment, when they are high is when he is feeling really stressed.",1

"My first boyfriend's love for this song killed me and did so for years.  I have heard it occasionally.  I used to feel bad that he shared this song with his X, but I didn't realize until later by the voices that he broke up with her for me first.  He is super successful now and has high degrees completed.  Meanwhile I have this messed up mind that I can't pass classes with.  I have only a low degree.  I would literally read a line and forget it.  The voices hurt me a lot with this as it relates to his success and it had me so depressed for two days.they were thing me they caused me to curse him so that made him successful and all he wanted from me is to love him again.",0
"My good friend died at school, & their death devastated me. Since then many people I have known, & friends have died. I don't quite know why; but I am unaffected by this. If it was very close certain family members then I think I would feel differently, but for decades I have been unaffected by people dying. The thought of my own death does not phase me at all. I do want a long life - but death, I would agree, can be looked at as a continuation of the adventure. I firmly believe in reincarnation, so much so that I see it as fact, I don't believe that the core aspect of who we are does die. Would those past, want us to be in pain at their passing? death I think is a natural part of life, it comes to us all, & to all things. There is often great creativity, regeneration, & growth in cycles of death, life's only constant is change, & death is something that we can be certain of.",1

"My wife is currently on Epival/Depakote (mood stabilizer) and Olanzapine (anti-psychotic). She has typically just taken Epival to help prevent manic episodes (with sporadic low doses of Seroquel for anxiety), though for her recent manic episode the hospital started her on Olanzapine to treat her acute mania. Her goal is to eventually go off the Olanzapine and stick with just the Epival when she is fully at baseline. Mono-therapy with just a mood stabilizer can be effective depending on the individual. Maybe it will work for you? However, my wife does not typically have psychotic episodes when manic - her recent one was maybe the second ever. If psychosis is more common for you, then perhaps you need to stick with an anti-psychotic also.",1

"Neurobiologically, if you brain has down-regulated (i.e. doesn't naturally produce sufficient) for GABA as a result of alcohol as an agonist (i.e. imitates the neurotransmitter), then you become dependent on alchohol.

"No he never predicted kobe's death. Zach has been the king of exaggerating his results and lying about them too. I've followed him for about 5 years and the way he presents himself seems authentic at first, then the more you hear his logic and get to know him his theories lose their credibility. Plus his personality is terrible. He keeps trying to convince us he's christ re-born. His words not mine. In fact ""a call for an uprising"" did a great vid exposing him that you can watch on youtube still. It's an hour long but very accurate. The problem with zach's numbers are that he comes up with legitimate numbers for both teams to win, hardly ever makes a bold pick, then when the game is over says ""see i told you i called it"". The driver he predicted for daytona 500 finished 20th. In fact we found legit numbers for each of the top 20 drivers so any of them could have fit the narrative for that day. Here's what zach does, let's say there are 12 games for a particular day. 4 of them he says he can't figure out. Then he goes 4-4 on the other 8 and puts up a headline of ""congrats! We went 3-0 on my top picks!"" ...and those 3 games were all heavy favs so you can't win on them anyway. He acts like he does a great job yet no one ever wins anything. He's a joke. And someone already killed themself cause they lost all their money on his bad picks. Yes he charges for his picks on patreon, or i should say used to charge. He just recently stopped doing sports picks. Probably because he was getting called out so much for how mediocre they were. He lost people tons of money. I was on his sports pick patreon for the last year so i saw it all.''",0

The east side of town is the epicenter for boorish rubes in raised ranches and a nice swath of section 8 housing near the track. Most of the eateries are high priced mediocrity?

"On 25 January, at least 2,000 people fled Nyesisi, Ngugo, Ruhanga, Ngombi, Mugwata, and Gikeri villages to Rugari Centre locality (Rutshuru territory), in Nord Kivu, following attacks attributed to the March 23 Movement (M23) on Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) positions in the area. Several houses were looted and destroyed. Most IDPs are in makeshift shelters, churches, schools, or with host families; some are sleeping in the open air. Most of them fled with no belongings and do not yet wish to return to their place of origin, fearing for their security. They urgently need assistance in food, WASH, shelter, and medicine supply. Since November 2021, several attacks in Nord Kivu province have been attributed to M23. The number IDPs is expected to increase in case of an intensification of clashes between FARDC and M23. The resurgence of this armed group defeated in 2013 raises fears about a worsening of the humanitarian situation in this province, where many armed groups are already active.",1

"Psychosis can be a symptom of any type of mood disorder, and just because an anti-psychotic is prescribed does not been you are branded psychotic.

"Pulte, who now owns the Del Webb brand, has told us that the smaller DW communities in NM are the wave of the future, this is the size of communities they want to build elsewhere.  The recession revealed a serious weakness in the business model the large home builders had previously used.  The large communities require an incredible amount of capital in terms of the required infrastructure investment, before they start making much return on that capital through home sales.  They got caught with tremendous amounts of invested capital and unsold lots when the recession hit.  Many of these companies suffered severely, some of the big ones went under and were acquired by others.  This caused them to change their basic business model to one that does not require nearly as much upfront investment.",0

People make such a big deal out of Arizona's summer monsoon, but it's really not that huge of a weather phenomenon when you consider all the other adverse conditions affecting the U.S. and beyond.  The monsoon is the summer rainy season, but mainly in SE Arizona and the White Mountains.  The Phoenix metro area and much of western AZ typically see occasional storm activity, but much of it is widely scattered, and confined to the evening hours.  Some areas can get no rain at all during an entire summer.  In the western half of the state (including Phoenix), the predominant rainy season is winter.  What we should be focusing on and embracing more is the winter precipitation, which is much more beneficial than summer thunderstorms.",0

"She has none that match her aspirations. Ivanka literally thinks she could be president. she just doesn't get it that almost no one likes her and she has no charisma, in fact she has negative charisma. she was only tolerated by the right because the love for Trump is so great. same thing with Don Jr. who thinks he's hot shit but again only the most mindless on the right think he's great",1
She has said to me that when she gets like that she just wants to be held which I find impossible because when I try she pushes me away and tells me she hates me.

I felt betrayed by the shop for encouraging girls to aspire to that size. My friend was upset that I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that I felt I would be colluding with her and the fashion industry that it was acceptable, and I couldn't do that. I felt that if I bought them and she decided upon recovery that those jeans would really hold her back if she couldn't fit in them any more, because these shops are making an emaciated frame seem acceptable, when I feel it clearly is not.",1

It was less than 20mins long because the psychotherapist wanted me referred back to a psychiatrist for diagnosis and medication assessment and has advised CPN involvement with me - however he has given me a follow up appointment which takes place next week, but I am not allowed to have my partner with me this time! Of course, I've heard nothing about the psychiatric appointment or visit to/from a CPN.",1

King's PTA is really, really active, and they generally have an annual budget approaching six figures (I mention that because they are really able to help out the school, teachers, and students).  Akron also has some absolutely amazing magnet middle schools - STEM [5-8] and Miller South [4-8] - which I can absolutely, positively guarantee none of the suburban districts have any sort of equivalent to (how many 4th grade classes take field trips to NYC?).  People open enroll their kids from the suburbs to go there.   You'll  also have company in that neighborhood as there are other UA staff and professors that live and send their kids to the local schools.  You will also find that most of the type of people you'll find around there are the same type of people you would find in the suburbs - mostly white collar professionals.",0

"The Bush is basically out in the wilderness. Miles from any town let alone a city like Anchorage or Fairbanks. May be villages or communities within a hundred miles or so.

You can drive yourself out to the middle of nowhere in some places and start walking. I would say pretty much the western part of the state is bush communities. The few towns/cities we have are fairly spread out with many villages or communities inbetween. Pretty much covers the whole state other than near the main towns and cities.

"The architecture of CRAN consists of the baseband unit (BBU), remote radio heads (RRHs), and common public radio interface (CPRI). C-RAN is the centralized baseband processing of many cells. It features improved performance with the help of its ability to coordinate between cells. Moreover, it serves as a cost-efficient solution, due to the pooling (grouping) of the resources. This is reflected in the architecture of the C-RAN, as all of the baseband unit (BBU) computational resources are combined into a central pool. Remote radio head (RRH) collects the radio frequency signals from the distribution antennas and further transmits it to the cloud platform through a communication interface or transmission network. The aim of the C-RAN architecture is to reduce the number of the cell sites while sustaining similar coverage, which will eventually result in reduced capital expenditure and decreased operating expenses while providing enhanced network services.",0

This is an important increase in comparison to 105 reported cases at the end of November. Humanitarian actors continue to support Ekondo Titi and Bakassi health districts in Ndian division. Access is worsened by poor roads while maritime access is challenging with the presence of pirates and limited resources to reach affected areas. The sea route was considered the safest means of access to the Ekondo-Titi subdivision, used by humanitarian organizations operating in Bamusso as an alternative to roads where there is a high number of NSAG attacks. The presence of pirates on this route has increased security risks for partners and will most likely hinder rapid and safe humanitarian access and the ability to implement activities, especially cholera outbreak related ones.",1

"This story is often read wrong. She tells him she is not a virgin and he ask her to tell him about it (page 7). She notices he gets hard as he asks her to tell him everything about her sexual past (page 8). She notes the painful expression he has at hearing about her cheating BUT he tells her nothing she says will make him hate her (page 10). Note in the following pages she carefully watches his face and feels him getting harder as she rides his cock as she tells about her past sexual experiences. By page 15 she has realized he gets more turned on the more graphic the sexual experience he tells him. As he is about to come inside her the first time she whispers in his ear ‘“he also came inside me when we did it for the first time” triggering him to have a huge orgasm. Then he says “that is not enough”, He wants to ‘overwrite’ all her past sexual memories so she needs to continues telling him of her past. By page 19 she is rooting him on by telling him to fuck her harder as she tells him her stories. Page 20 she tells him her past lover fucked her in his car, something he can not match since he has no car. This has the effect of turning him on even more as he jealously declares he will make her forget about her past and fill her with memories of only him. After the sex is done she confesses that she lied and no one has ever come inside her but him and that she is already in love with him he does not need to worry about her past memories that she is committed to being with him alone.",1

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Last month, U.S. employers might have shed jobs for the first time in about a year, potentially raising alarms about the economy’s trajectory. Yet even if the January employment report coming Friday were to show a deep loss of jobs, there would be little mystery about the likely culprit: A wave of omicron infections that led millions of workers to stay home sick, discouraged consumers from venturing out to spend and likely froze hiring at many companies — even those that want to fill jobs. Reported omicron infections peaked at above 800,000 a day during the second week of January — precisely the period when the government measured employment for the month.",0

From there it’s layering and texture to create the illusion of depth. How you do this obviously depends on the hair type.",0
