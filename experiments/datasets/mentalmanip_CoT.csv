85514422,"Person1: He's dead.
Person2: We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Person1: No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Person2: Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Person1: Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Person2: I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Person1: No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Person2: Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
